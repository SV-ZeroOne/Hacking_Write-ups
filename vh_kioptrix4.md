## Introduction 

Welcome to the last installment of the Kioptrix VM series.

> "Keeping in the spirit of things, this challenge is a bit different than the others but remains in the realm of the easy. Repeating myself I know, but things must always be made clear: These VMs are for the beginner. Itâ€™s a place to start."

## Initial recon

### Nmap scan

Starting with an aggressive (-A) fast (-T4) scan off all TCP ports on the machine and output the results to all formats (-oA).
```
sudo nmap -A -T4 -vv -p- -oA tcp_all_ports_agg 10.0.2.8
```

We can also conduct a relatively quick UDP version scan of the top 1000 ports.
```
sudo nmap -sUV -vv -oA udp_ver_top1000 10.0.2.8
```

#### TCP Scan Results

There is an HTTP web server running on port 80 as well as SSH on ports 22 and SMB ports 139 and 445 open on the system.

## Enumeration

Since we see that port 80 is open lets enumerate the Website.

We are greeted with what appears to be a simple HTTP POST form login page. It appears that the login is susceptible to an SQL injection bypass attack using the following string in the password field to gain login without a password.

```
' or 1=1 -- -
```

![Kioptrix 4 Website login](/Images/vh_kioptrix4_webpage_1.jpg)

However trying to login as **admin** user reveals nothing interesting so we need to see if we can find any other usernames on the system.


### SMB

We can potentially find some details by enumerating the SMB ports.

We can use enum4linux script and scan all (-a) and output the results to a results file.
```
sudo enum4linux -a 10.0.2.8 | tee enum4linux_results.txt
```

The enum4linux script reveals the following bits of information that can help use further.

```

```

Looks like we found a few other users **(john, loneferret and robert)** of interest that we can try to use to log into the web application.

Logging into the application as John reveals the following details.

**Note** - You will have to clear the _PHPSESSID_ cookie each try to get clear results otherwise the web application seems to behave oddly not revealing any legitimate results.

![Kioptrix 4 John Login details](/Images/vh_kioptrix4_webpage_2.jpg)

Trying to use these details to login SSH on port 22 works, however it seems like we are in an custom restricted shell called **LigGoat shell** with limited commands.

![Escaping restricted shell](/Images/vh_kioptrix4_restricted_shell_1.jpg)

As you can see we are limited to the following commands
* cd
* clear
* echo
* exit
* help
* ll
* lpath
* ls

After some research we can use the following **echo** command to escape from the shell and gain a full bash shell by using a python system command.

```
echo os.system('/bin/bash')
```

Here is a great list of commands that can be used to spawn TTY shell and also be used to escape same jailed shells.

## Privilege Escalation

Checking out the /var/www/ folder to see the source code for the login script (checklogin.php) reveals a few interesting bits of information such as the MySQL databases username and blank password. It also shows us the SQL query that we exploited via SQL injection to login to the web application.

```php

        session_register("mypassword");

?>
```

Since the username of the database user is **root** lets check to see if the MySQL service is running as root permissions. If this is the case we can use this along with an SQL UDF (User-Defined Function) to gain root privileges.

Use the following command to see all running process.
```
ps aux
```

![MySQL Root process](/Images/vh_kioptrix4_mysql_privesc_1.jpg)

This blog post by Bernardo Dag exploits the exploit pretty well.

![Blog link](https://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2009/01/command-execution-with-mysql-udf.html)

Basically we can use the UDF functionality within MySQL to execute system commands on the underlying operating system.

To do so, we need to download the lib_mysqludf_sys.so library, which will allow us to perform commands to escalate our privileges to root.

![lib_muysqludf_sys.so download repo](https://github.com/mysqludf/lib_mysqludf_sys)

We can use the following command to see if we have the correct library on the system.
```
ls -la /usr/lib/lib_mysqludf_sys.so 
```

Since its already on the system there is no need to download it.

The library implements the following 3 functions we can potentially use.
* sys_exec: executes an arbitrary command, and can thus be used to launch an external application.
* sys_get: gets the value of an environment variable.
* sys_set: create an environment variable, or update the value of an existing environment variable.

The easiest method would be to use the sys_exec function to give our user john admin permissions on the system. Login to the mysql database console as root and execute the following command to gain root access to the system.
```
select sys_exec('usermod -a -G admin john');
```

![MySQL privilege escalation](/Images/vh_kioptrix4_mysql_privesc_2.jpg)

As you can see we gained root on the system!

## Summary

Overall this box was pretty fun as it involved piecing together a few bits of critical information in order to get access to the box and then root it.
As you can see below loneferret states there are two ways to root the box. We demonstrated the 1 way above using the MySQL UDF privilege escalation technique the other approach would be to use a Linux Kernel exploit as the machine is running a relatively old version of the kernel that is vulnerable
